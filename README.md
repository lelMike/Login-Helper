# Login-Helper
The Login-Helper is a tool that helps keep track of all your logins, stored in a .json file. When you need any of the login details, it can conveniently copy them automatically to clipboard, ready to paste. Very basic and cluttered version at the moment, it's my first ever project, will be regularly updated and improved :)

Before running you may need to type 'pip install pyperclip' and 'pip install keyboard' into the terminal. This will install the needed libraries used in the project.
